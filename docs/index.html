			<p>This webapp is for simulating outpost, assault, and/or other objectives for Nerf, Airsoft, Paintball, or Water War games. Supports most screen sizes, and supports touch and keyboard/mouse. Requires an up-to-date HTML5-compliant browser.</p>
			<p>Setting up a game is straightforward and simply involves filling out the form. Following is an explanation of each field.</p>
			<h4>Score Limit</h4>
			<p>Number of points needed for a team to win. Currently does not support infinite values.</p>
			<h4>Time Limit</h4>
			<p>Game ends automatically after the time limit expires. Games can be instantaneous or up to just under 24 hours.</p>
			<h4>Objective Type</h4>
			<p>Outpost sets up a control point style objective for capture. Teams must hold down the capture button for a set duration to take the control point, and may earn points for capturing and/or holding the control point.</p>
			<p>Bomb sets up an assault style objective for attack. To score, the attacking team must plant the bomb. If successful, the opposing team must try to diffuse the bomb before it activates.</p>
			<h4>Usable By Teams</h4>
			<p>Specifies which teams may use the objective to score.</p>
			<p>In Outpost, this can be set to allow only one team to take the control point.</p>

			<p><strong>Points for Capture:</strong> Points rewarded to the team that captures the control point.</p>
			<p><strong>Ownership Scoring:</strong> Points rewarded to the team that owns the control point, given every second or every minute.</p>
